Chinese Astrology Program

Overview
The Chinese Astrology Program** is a Python application that determines the user's Chinese zodiac animal based on their birth year. It provides a short summary of the characteristics associated with the zodiac animal and a link for the user to learn more. This project offers users insight into the rich tradition of Chinese astrology in a user-friendly format.

Features
- Calculates the user's Chinese zodiac animal based on their birth year.
- Provides a 4-line summary of the zodiac animal's traits.
- Includes a link to further information about the user's Chinese zodiac animal.
- Handles invalid input with appropriate error messages.

How it Works
1. The user inputs their birth year.
2. The program calculates the Chinese zodiac animal by using a modulo operation to map the year to the correct animal in a 12-year repeating cycle.
3. The program then displays:
   - The user's zodiac animal.
   - A summary of the animal's characteristics.
   - A link for the user to explore more about their zodiac animal.

Installation and Setup
1. Clone or Download the Repository:**
   - If using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/chinese-astrology-program.git
     cd chinese-astrology-program
     ```
   - Or you can download the ZIP file from the repository and extract it.

2. Install Python (if not already installed):
   - You need Python 3.x to run the program. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. Run the Program:
   - Once Python is installed, navigate to the directory where the program is saved.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
     ```bash
     python chinese_astrology_program.py
     ```

4. Follow the On-Screen Prompts:
   - Enter your birth year to receive your zodiac animal and additional information.

Error Handling
- The program checks if the user inputs a valid year.
- If the input is invalid (e.g., non-numeric), the program prompts the user to try again with a correct format.
